what: match a request and a server_block (from configuration file)

based on: [IP, port and "server name"]
...to be found:
    - in server_block: 
        - "server_name" directive
        - "listen" (= IP + port) directive
    - in request:
        - server IP and port the server is listening to (from server configuration)
        - "host" header (= server_name)
    Rq: le "server_name" peut aussi être donné sous forme d'IP[:port] (dans le "host" ou dans la directive "server_name")

how:
    1. based on listen directives (IP + port) vs server configuration
        a. translate all "incomplete" listen directives (eg: 80 -> 0.0.0.0:80) 
        -> one or more matching listen directives
        b. if muliple matching listen directives, discard 0.0.0.0 IPs 
        -> one or more matching listen directives
        c. if muliple matching listen directives, evaluate server_name directive (2.)

    2. based on server_name directive vs "host" header
        a. if exact match between host and server_name 
        -> if muliple exact match, chose the 1st server block in the configuration
        (b. handle wildcards in "server_name" ? handle regex ? [ ... NO ? :) ...])
        c. if no match in a. and b., select default server block: the first server block in the configuration
